<font color="red">好消息，国内第一款免费开源的机器学习软件已经发布，只需要点击鼠标即可完成几百行代码才能完成的机器学习任务，链接如下: https://github.com/lichao312214129/easylearn</font>

- "**pre-processing**" is used to pre-process our data, such as extracting head motion and demographic matching.  
 
- "**network\_construction**" is used to construct the dynamic and static networks.

- "**clustering**" is used to perform kmeans clustering on dynamic functional connectivity and obtain each subject's median network of each state.

- "**stat**" is used to statistical analysis, such as ANCOVA, post-hoc two-sample t- test, and get shared(common) dysconnectivity across these 3 disorders.

- "**visualization**" is used to visualize our results.
